# Blackjack
This Python program implements a simple version of the popular card game, Blackjack. 
The game is played between a player and a dealer. The objective is to obtain cards that add up to as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. 
Face cards are worth 10 points, Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points (player's choice), and all other cards are worth their face value.
